# CropChain
CropChain is a blockchain, QR/RFID, and IoT-based farmer-centric platform for authenticating seeds. It traces seed lots from supplier to soil, saves important information such as source and certification, and tracks conditions such as temperature. It assists farmers in avoiding counterfeit seeds and making sure decisions confidently and safely.
